# NeroSound  
**Advanced SoundBoard for Foundry VTT**

A module for creating and managing customizable SoundBoards inside Foundry VTT, with support for folders, sections, images, and colors to organize and trigger audio quickly during your games.

---

## Overview

Nero Sound allows you to load and manage audio files through a dedicated SoundBoard system. You can create multiple boards, organize your sounds into sections, and visually customize them to keep your audio library clean and easy to use.

This module is built for GMs who work with large collections of sound files and want a fast, visual workflow during sessions.

## What problem does it solve?

Foundry VTT supports audio playback, but handling dozens or hundreds of files becomes slow and chaotic when done through raw playlists or directories.

**Nero Sound** provides a structured SoundBoard environment where you can:

- Separate audio into multiple Boards
- Organize with sections and subfolders
- Assign images and colors to sounds
- Play multiple sounds at once
- Instantly see what is currently playing

---

## How does it work?

Create a Board, load your sounds, and play them. You can configure each sound’s properties or create sections to keep everything organized.

---

## Features

- Create SoundBoards with sections to load, organize, and manage audio.
- Customize the order, color, and representative image of each sound.
- Play multiple sounds simultaneously.
- Configure each sound to play once or loop.
- Easily identify which sounds are currently playing.
